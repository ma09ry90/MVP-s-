#Challenges
Technical Challenges: One challenge that became apparent after starting development was the complexity of implementing a payment gateway and admin interface. Initially, it seemed feasible, but as the project progressed, it became clear that these features required not only significant time and technical resources but also legal and business expertise to ensure compliance and profitability. This complexity was not fully understood during the initial research phase.
Plan Adaptation: To address these challenges, the scope of the project was adjusted. The decision was made to remove the payment gateway and admin interface, simplifying the project to focus on the core functionality of Ushelf. The project was redefined to allow users to organize digital books, invite others to their shelves, and set calendar reminders and email notifications. This change allowed the project to remain manageable within the available time frame and resources.
Non-Technical Challenges: Unexpectedly, the project encountered non-technical challenges such as the need for legal consultation and business planning. These were beyond the scope of the original plan, which focused primarily on technical development. Additionally, time management became an issue due to unforeseen power outages in the my city, which impacted the ability to work consistently.
#Progress
On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate my progress this week as a 7. I measure my progress not just by the technical milestones I planned to achieve but also by how I adapted to unexpected challenges. I give myself this rating because, although I didn't accomplish as much as I had hoped due to recurring power outages in my city, I still managed to make progress by exploring alternative power options. Despite these setbacks, I am confident that I can complete the project on time by working more strategically.
